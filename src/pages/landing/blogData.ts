      <p>The UNI token is the governance token of the Uniswap protocol, one of the largest decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Ethereum and other compatible blockchains.</p>
      
      <p>According to <a href="https://sharlife.my/crypto-shariah" target="_blank">Sharlife.my</a> and <a href="https://mrhb.network/" target="_blank">Sahal Wallet (MRHB DeFi)</a> the token is permissible.</p>
      
      <h2>Main utilities of the UNI token:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>UNI holders can participate in the decentralized governance of the Uniswap protocol.</li>
        <li><strong>Delegated Participation.</strong> If you don't vote yourself, you can delegate your voting power to trusted community members or DAOs who participate actively in governance.</li>
        <li><strong>Potential utility in the future:</strong> Fee Distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Proposal to reward UNI holders:</strong> There's been discussion (and votes) around implementing a "fee switch" — a mechanism that could distribute a portion of swap fees to UNI holders. If enacted, this could resemble a yield-like reward for participants, but it's not Proof-of-Stake, and it's not active yet.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Why hasn't the Fee Switch (fee distribution) been enabled yet?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>LPs might leave if they start receiving less.</li>
        <li>There is no technical implementation for distributing revenue to UNI holders.</li>
        <li>Legal risks: revenue may turn UNI into a security.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>UNI is a utility token, not a cryptocurrency with it's own consensus protocol. There is no Proof-of-Stake in such cases.</p>
      
      <p>That means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>❌ UNI is not a staking token for validating blocks (like ETH on Ethereum PoS).</li>
        <li>❌ UNI does not secure the Uniswap protocol through any consensus mechanism.</li>
        <li>❌ UNI Does not currently give block rewards or protocol revenue directly to holders.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Considering this, using UNI for staking in vaults for additional yield is better to avoid at this point, because it is possible that the token will be used in lending protocols for generating that yield. The only potential additional option for UNI is providing liquidity.</p>

      <p><a href="https://sharlife.my/crypto-shariah/crypto/pi-network" target="_blank">Sharlife</a> has marked the project as permissible.</p>
      
      <p>Pi Network is a social cryptocurrency, a developer platform, and an ecosystem designed for broad accessibility and practical use. It allows users to mine and transact with Pi through a user-friendly mobile interface while supporting applications built within its blockchain ecosystem.</p>
      
      <p>Essentially, it is a simplified version of Bitcoin with additional features, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A commercial program for using the token in businesses to pay for goods and services</li>
        <li>Its own browser</li>
        <li>A user verification system</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The Pi App Incubator program supports community developers in creating and deploying applications that ultimately provide useful services to network participants and expand the ecosystem's practical use.</p>
      
      <p>Based on the information available on the website, no suspicious applications have been developed within the ecosystem so far. Therefore, at this time, there are no reasons to ban the buying/selling or mining of the Pi token. We will continue to monitor the project's development.</p>
      
      <p>There is no Proof of Stake consensus, the chain functions on Proof of Work protocol, which is "mining". This is why any so called "staking" or other instrument with a fixed yield for this cryptocurrency is at least questionable, because it lacks participating in creating new blockchain transactions in the blockchain.</p>
      
      <p>You can read more about Proof-of-Stake protocol on our Blogs section below this crypto list. However, we are not talking about other pledge or liquidity tools that involves PI. Those tools will require separate analysis.</p>

      <p>Sharlife, Crypto Islam, and other committees prohibit some meme coins such as $TRUMP, $PEPE, and $SHIB. Their main concern is the lack of practical utility and real-world application of these tokens.</p>
      
      <p>Considering what we wrote <a href="https://ethicalnode.com/meme-coins-halal-or-haram-2/" target="_blank">in our previous post</a>, such a ban can indeed help those looking for tokens to make a quick profit. It is very easy to lose money or earn questionable income by jumping on a wave with big players who will eventually wipe out smaller investors.</p>
      
      <p>We do not defend meme coins. However, it is important to acknowledge that some meme coins can evolve and become fundamental assets with real practical applications. A good example of this is DOGE.</p>
      
      <p>In this context, we prefer to place a question mark on such meme coins and consider them questionable.</p>
      
      <p>As for $TRUMP, here is a quote from the token's official website:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Trump memes are intended as a means of expressing support and engaging with the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol '$TRUMP' and its associated artwork. They are not intended as an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any kind. The meme has no political affiliation and is not associated with any political campaign, public office, or government entity."</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Everyone should carefully consider where they invest their money.</p>
      
      <p>At Ethical Node, such tokens are assigned the status "Questionable", allowing each individual to form their own conclusion on whether to engage with them considering information from this and previous posts.</p>

      <p>Let's look at DOGE coin as an example. Technically, it is no different from Bitcoin.</p>
      
      <p>DOGE is backed by a community and supported by Elon Musk, similar to other meme coins like BRETT and NOT, which have specific functions within their respective ecosystems.</p>
      
      <p>From the perspective of Islamic fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), money can be anything that serves as a medium of exchange—whether gold, silver, flower petals, leather, or paper—as long as it is widely accepted by people. In short, cryptocurrencies qualify as money if they are commonly recognized (ʿurf) and can be classified as māl (property), specifically intangible property.</p>
      
      <p>Based on the principle that the default ruling on things is permissibility, my personal opinion is that fundamental meme coins, by their very nature, cannot be inherently prohibited. If a user or investor understands and aligns with the values of a community, then the decision to use or invest in a particular coin should rest with the individual.</p>
      
      <p>However, a new category of meme coins has emerged—those created purely for speculation, designed to manipulate the market for profit, commonly known as "pump and dump" schemes. Some blockchains, such as Solana, have facilitated the rise of such meme coins, which often lack a solid foundation and experience rapid price fluctuations.</p>
      
      <h2>It is important to distinguish between two types of meme coins:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fundamental meme coins</strong> – Those with a strong community, real-world utility, and long-term potential.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-fundamental meme coins</strong> – Speculative assets created for quick profits, often lacking substance and prone to collapse.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Recognizing the difference between these two categories is crucial for making informed investment decisions.</p>
      
      <p>If a meme coin has a solid foundation, an active community, and clear development prospects, that is one scenario. How can you determine this? If you are willing to hold the coin long-term, believing in its growth and real-world applications (as seen with DOGE, NOT, and BRETT), then such a meme coin can be considered fundamental.</p>
      
      <p>However, if a coin has no use case and is bond to collapse, yet you hold it short-term to profit off later investors, this approach is clearly impermissible.</p>
      
      <p>Allah knows best.</p>

      <p>The question of whether staking Ethereum is halal has been addressed by several Shariah committees, including Amanie Advisors, a registered Shariah advisory firm. With the Securities Commission Malaysia they confirm that participating in Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocol aligns with Islamic principles.</p>
      
      <p>However, a deeper dive into staking reveals some complexities. While staking itself can be permissible, Ethereum is a Layer 1 blockchain with decentralized apps (dApps) that may host impermissible activities like derivative trading, gambling, lending, and borrowing. These activities could potentially result in validators benefiting from questionable transactions that are recorded on the blockchain. 😬</p>
      
      <p>🔍</p>
      
      <p>In light of this, we believe it is questionable to participate in staking for Ethereum until further analysis is conducted by modern scholars. This applies not only to Ethereum but also to other Layer 1 blockchains like Solana, Cardano, Polkadot, Tron, Ton, Mantra, Avalanche, Algorand, Chromia, WAX, EOS, etc. ⚖️</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Good News:</strong> There's a solution! New technology has been developed that enables Ethereum block validation while avoiding interest-based transactions. We're also working on enabling this technology on our platform and expanding it to ensure compliance with Islamic principles across various blockchains.</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Bottom Line:</strong> Staking on Layer 1 blockchains may not be entirely pure due to the potential for impermissible transactions. But innovation is paving the way for a solution that aligns with Shariah. 🙌</p>

      <h2>Introduction to Staking in Islam</h2>
      <p>Assalamu Alaikum! The question of staking's permissibility in Islam has become increasingly important as more blockchain networks adopt Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms.</p>
      
      <h2>Understanding Proof-of-Stake</h2>
      <p>Proof-of-Stake is a consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on their stake in the network, rather than computational power.</p>
      
      <h2>Islamic Perspective on Staking</h2>
      <h3>Arguments for Permissibility:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Staking provides a legitimate service (network security)</li>
        <li>Rewards are compensation for work, not interest</li>
        <li>Risk is involved (slashing conditions)</li>
        <li>No lending or borrowing involved</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Concerns Raised:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Guaranteed returns might resemble interest</li>
        <li>Passive income concerns</li>
        <li>Complexity of some staking mechanisms</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Scholarly Consensus</h2>
      <p>The majority of contemporary Islamic scholars who have studied blockchain technology consider basic staking to be permissible, comparing it to legitimate business partnerships.</p>
      
      <h2>Best Practices for Muslim Stakers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose Shariah-compliant networks</li>
        <li>Understand the staking mechanism</li>
        <li>Avoid excessive leverage</li>
        <li>Regular scholarly consultation</li>

      <p><strong>Assalamu Alaikum!</strong></p>
      
      <p>What rulings do we have about the permissibility of participating in Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol?</p>
      
      <p class="arabic">الحمد لله رب العالمين، والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله، وعلى آله وأصحابه واتباعه ومن استن بسُنته إلى يوم الدين.</p>
      
      <p>Let's start with two important points:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Not every "staking" is part of the Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol. Below, we will outline three possibilities for participating in so-called "staking."</li>
        <li>Not every Proof-of-Stake protocol falls under the same conclusion.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Why is Proof-of-Stake not like "Riba"?</h2>
      
      <p>In the last post, we mentioned that the Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol is a method of authenticating transactions in new blocks and ensuring that all calculations of users funds are correct.</p>
      
      <p>The "stake" of funds in this protocol acts as a pledge, making the validator responsible for their role, which involves writing and calculating the outcomes of transactions on the network.</p>
      
      <p>There is no debt involved in this process. This pledge is not taken by anyone; instead, the blockchain program locks these funds. The validator cannot access the funds. The delegator (client) can only withdraw it himself after waiting for 21, 14, or 28 days.</p>
      
      <p>The rewards for this activity are generated simply by crediting the newly emerged cryptocurrency to the account of the server (i.e., the validator) that performed the computation of the last transactions into new block. Income from Proof-of-Stake is a form of payment for services rendered.</p>
      
      <h2>Three Situations Outlined by Shaykh Joe Bradford:</h2>
      
      <h3>1) Non-Proof-of-Stake "Staking" - HARAM</h3>
      <p>You participate in so-called "staking" that has nothing to do with the Proof-of-Stake protocol. In that case, you give your crypto assets to another party, which takes them and pays you an interest rate, similar to a cash-on-cash loan. This is Haram.</p>
      
      <p>In this scenario you provide the capital, and they guarantee to return it along with a premium, regardless of whether you contribute any work, and regardless of whether they make more or less than the quoted rate.</p>
      
      <h3>2) Ponzi Scheme Payments - HARAM</h3>
      <p>The other party pays you from the crypto purchased by new coin holders. This is Haram. If they take your coins and pay you from the coins of new buyers, it constitutes a Ponzi scheme and is considered misappropriation of others' wealth (Arabic: أكل أموال الناس بالباطل), which is not permitted.</p>
      
      <h3>3) Legitimate Delegated Proof-of-Stake - HALAL</h3>
      <p>The other side takes your crypto and use it to verify the blockchain and help compute on the virtual machine / network. This is Halal.</p>
      
      <p>If "staking" means to take your crypto and add it to a node to verify transactions, contribute to security, and provide computing functions AND your participation and rewards are not guaranteed but are contingent on selection and contribution criteria, then you are partnering with them and this is permissible.</p>
      
      <p>On the <a href="https://ethicalnode.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ethicalnode.com</a> there is a list of cryptocurrencies where you will see whether or not it is comfortable to participate in POS of specific blockchain according to an analysis that is based on shariah standards.</p>

      <p>Whenever we mention the "staking" it refers to Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol that helps secure blockchains and provides validation of transactions.</p>
      
      <p>Not every instrument that claims to be "staking" is actually proof-of-stake, where the validator's funds are locked in the blockchain as a pledge by which he is responsible for correctness of the calculations in the new block and the permanence of his server's operation.</p>
      
      <h2>The Key Difference from Fiat Money</h2>
      
      <p>The concept of consensus protocol that was started with Bitcoin in a form of Proof-of-Work (mining) and continues with Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, Cosmos, etc. in a form of Proof-of-Stake is a key difference between fiat money and decentralized value.</p>
      
      <p>Since the cancellation of the gold and currency standard the fiat money had been printing without being backed with real assets, as it was when the paper money was first created in a form of debt receipt proving that you own a certain amount of gold, silver, copper, etc.</p>
      
      <p>The key is in the fact that supply of paper money is rising, while supply of gold is not. The emission of cryptocurrency is fundamentally different, because there is no printing of new Bitcoin, Ethereum or Atom without the process of proving that the recent operations in this system are being written and sealed without the possibility of revocation or modification.</p>
      
      <p>Only after this process is done and new block is formed, the new cryptocurrency is credited to the account who did the job.</p>
      
      <h2>Mining vs Staking: Two Methods of Validation</h2>
      
      <p><strong>"Mining" and "Staking" – Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake – are simply two methods of the process of proving safety and validating transactions.</strong></p>
      
      <p>In the POW the whole world is hashing the information until someone finds the variation of number that results in certain consecutive zeros in the hash.</p>
      
      <p>In the POS the algorithm is automatically giving the job of validation to various servers where the funds are locked as a pledge. The more funds is locked and for the more time – the more chances of being chosen. After you did the job, your time resets in order for others to have a change to do the work and get the reward.</p>
      
      <h2>The Main Question</h2>
      
      <p><strong>So the main question, is participating in Proof-of-Stake consensus for monetary benefits permissible for Muslims in a form of validation or delegation? Is "Staking" Halal or Haram?</strong></p>
      
      <p>We will answer this question in the next posts.</p>

      <p>You can find the Shariah analysis for trading a specific token in the list on the main page. However, we need to make a clarification. Today the common meaning of the word "trading" is closer to speculations and gambling rather than to the process of buying/selling itself, which has been the case for the most part of history.</p>
      
      <p>In that process both sides benefit from the transaction/exchange and agree for it. However, today's market has more nuances, including Federal Reserve policy, market manipulation by major players, world politics, etc.</p>
      
      <h2>The Problem with Short-Term Trading</h2>
      
      <p>In this context day-to-day or even week-to-week trading is closer to gambling, where the same group of people are buying and selling assets to each other on the market, trying to predict the closest future price for the asset and to play out the bigger players on the market.</p>
      
      <p>This can turn out in the loss of capital for the majority of players due to emotions, rash decisions and lack of experience. We do not recommend for one to try to gain short term profits from trading on one's own.</p>
      
      <h2>Recommended Approach: Long-Term Investment</h2>
      
      <p>A more secure approach is to consistently invest a portion of your income over the long term by purchasing crypto assets and averaging down your positions during price declines.</p>
      
      <p>On the contrary, people might ask "What is the difference between buying and selling everyday and once in a year? It is the same action". Yes, we cannot put exact time limits for this process. However, because of the complexity of the market, we say that it goes down to intention.</p>
      
      <p>We cannot categorically state that crypto trading is impermissible, as there is no clear boundary. Technically, it is simply a matter of buying and selling. However, we must also be mindful of other factors, including who is purchasing my asset on the other side and including the natural market growth resulting from an increasing number of participants drawn in by the potential of decentralization.</p>
      
      <h2>Expert Opinion</h2>
      
      <p>We conclude this topic with the statement of <strong>Zokir Ibragimov</strong> – the founder of Ethical Node platform and AAOIFI Certified Shari'ah Advisor and Auditor, MBA, Entreprenuer:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Opinions in the Muslim world are divided regarding the permissibility of trading. If a trader is skilled, has significant experience, and stable results, and trades according to Shariah norms—without margin trading, futures, etc.—then I believe there would be no sin in using their services.</p>
        
        <p>But my opinion in principle remains unchanged: trading walks a fine line next to gambling speculation, which is very dangerous for most people. However, in matters where there is ikhtilaf (disagreement) among scholars, I do not try to force my opinion vehemently.</p>
        
        <p>I believe it is essential to adhere to one of the main principles in fiqh, which is that the default is permissibility.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Allah knows best.</strong>"</p>
